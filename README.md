# Fetch-Rewards-Coding-Exercise

I completed this exercise based on Jupyter notebook, so [fetch_rewards_test.ipynb](fetch_rewards_test.ipynb) would be main answers for this exercise. 



[ERD_RECEIPTS.png](ERD_RECEIPTS.png) are answers to First question and [sql_query.txt](sql_query.txt) would be supplementary to answers of Second part. 

For third part, answers are in the PART 3 of [fetch_rewards_test.ipynb](fetch_rewards_test.ipynb). 

Use Jupyter notebook might be not friendly to  non-technical stakeholders, but I include some explanations and charts to make it easy to read.
